## 🧠 About

This repository is my personal digital lab notebook, designed for:

- Paper readings (organized by topic and publication date)
- Experiment logs (chronologically tracked)
- Insights and reflections (time-stamped)
- Summaries & how-to notes (for engineering, theory, and best practices)

> Most notes are bilingual (English & 中文)

## 🏷️ Philosophy

This is a living, imperfect, and ever-growing notebook-some notes may be outdated, but all reflect my research journey.
